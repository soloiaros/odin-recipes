The first project of The Odin Project's curriculum.

It is meant to be representative of the new skills of using HTML conventions and basic functionality when creating a website.
It is worth noting that the project is not meant to be aesthetically pleasing or particularly functional at the beginning as no CSS or JS will be used but raw HTML. However, it can showcase all the essentials learned during the first half of the introductory course of The Odin Project.
